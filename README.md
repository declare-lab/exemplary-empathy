Comparison of responses with and without empathetic losses.

Top exemplars from the DPR model fine-tuned on Empathetic Dialogs, and the original pre-trained DPR checkpoint without any further training. The
exemplars from the fine-tuned DPR model are considerably more empathetic, diverse and contextually relevant. Notably, exemplars from the fine-tuned DPR are
not always semantically similar to the references, although they are stylistically plausible and relevant with respect to the context.
