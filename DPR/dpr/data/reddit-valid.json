The genetic aspects aren't their fault of course, but they are perfect human specimens, so you can imagine what 17 years of always being wrong has done to my self esteem and thought process. Strangely, being cognizant of that fact doesn't change it much. Of course, I've directly told my parents I blame them for who I am, and as perfect specimens, they told me that I can't keep blaming them for everything. There's truth to that of course, but it's rather incredible that they can find the gall to abdicate themselves of all guilt and responsibility. I'd better just get on my hands and knees and obey their every whim, since they're the ones who work and pay for my existence, regardless of whether or not I can actually do jack shit about that (child labor laws, yo).

It's a daily nightmare. I would say that MAYBE, if I gave advice on it, it would be that I used to have a similar thing with shyness, and with that I pushed myself into more and more social situations and now am not so shy. It MAYBE might work the same way with liking/disliking social interaction. But I do that everyday and I still don't like people. I'm more COMFORTABLE around them, but I still don't LIKE them. And it's an entirely different ball park with depression/anxiety than shyness, otherwise if it were so easy to just 'force' yourself to socialize to fix the problem, I'd be doing it myself.

I learned how to deal with the symptoms a lot better than I did from years prior.. looking back.. thst could've gone poorly. I'd recommend being open in discussion with your psychiatrist about the effects these drugs are having on your body and your mood. There are quite a few drug combinations for this type of diagnosis, and it would be wise to work dilligently with your psychiatrist until you find the combination for you. Don't be afraid of them changing your meds. They aren't work anyway, so you may as well be open to working with professionals to find something that works for you and your body. I'd also recommend to try being aware as possible if the symptoms, the triggers for those symptoms, and look to grow from them even while on these medications. Keep a close eye out for unwanted side effects. A lot of the medicines they may try to prescribe would require regular schedules blood work. I'll be honest, I did the irresponsible thing and ended up just not taking them. I got tired of taking medicine at that point; because, I had been taking it all my life. Whether it was for childhood epilepsy, ADHD, depression, and the last diagnosis cyclothymia. Was hospitalized twice before I got the cyclothymia diagnosis, and it was pretty bad at one point, and looking back.. I'm really lucky I didn't mess myself up by just stopping cold turkey.

It feels like psychological life-support. My question is, is this what meds are supposed to be? Just little bumpers to keep you from falling off the deep end? Do people take meds and actually experience...happiness in their life? Now asked this question to people (whom I know also take meds) straight to their face and I get a distinct feeling like being lied to as they tell me that they know what I mean, or that happy because they have a great family or whatever. But what are these meds really supposed to DO?"

Being terminally ill for the past 7 years (Im 42 now) the physical pain of a slow and horrible illness has led to my depression and desire to die. It is up to my wife though. And for her I live every day in hell. When you have even one person to keep you going, it can be enough. I am a lurker here and I read posts to give me perspective. Rarely can I physically reply. But what my experience being bound to a bed 24/7 has taught me is that once I made my peace with dying, I became indifferent to everything. For myself It's been tough to see people truly depressed to the point of wanting to die. I am very empathetic, but my depression is a symptom so its hard to understand. The one thing I do understand though is that the last thing you want to hear is Don't do it!!! Call this number... or other similar programmed/indoctrinated responses. So just know this... The world and life can be one big shitshow... So it helps to keep toilet paper handy. Let your friend be your toilet paper and be your friends toilet paper. It will be enough.  Lastly... Just remember that no matter how bad life feels (and is...) even I am artificially grateful for the fact that I have a far better life right now (suffering from *pain and bound to a bed), than 99.999999% of all humans to have ever lived. Just try to make it as long as you can. Know how much worse it can be. And let your toilet paper know that you need them to help clean up some shit. Then when you are ready to go.... You will know. But I cant see it happening for you as long as you remain attached to someone that you can call a friend. So give yourself a list of requirements that must be met for you to end it all. *- Pain so severe that causes me to vomit my own feces at times as it sends my body into shock. I wish you the best. I hope you can suffer less in time if possible. You and I are here right now... That makes us stronger than those who gave up yesterday. (And if you do one day come to the realization that you must go, make sure to do it in a way that allows your organs be given to help others. It helps me knowing that maybe I will have something that can give a healthy, long, and amazing life for a person who is still able to live it. ) Just think about making the list... And go tell your friend, right now, that you love him/her... Even if they are not quilted and only 1-ply thickness. You both need that right now... The whole world needs that right now.

I learned how to deal with the symptoms a lot better than I did from years prior.. looking back.. thst could've gone poorly. I'd recommend being open in discussion with your psychiatrist about the effects these drugs are having on your body and your mood. There are quite a few drug combinations for this type of diagnosis, and it would be wise to work dilligently with your psychiatrist until you find the combination for you. Don't be afraid of them changing your meds. They aren't work anyway, so you may as well be open to working with professionals to find something that works for you and your body. I'd also recommend to try being aware as possible if the symptoms, the triggers for those symptoms, and look to grow from them even while on these medications. Keep a close eye out for unwanted side effects. A lot of the medicines they may try to prescribe would require regular schedules blood work. I'll be honest, I did the irresponsible thing and ended up just not taking them. I got tired of taking medicine at that point; because, I had been taking it all my life.

Was hospitalized twice before I got the cyclothymia diagnosis, and it was pretty bad at one point, and looking back.. I'm really lucky I didn't mess myself up by just stopping cold turkey.

I couldn't talk to my mom for the life of me, my sister would tell my mom or tell me I was wrong, my dad just gave me a look and didn't know what to say besides he cares about me. Once my mom knew the extent of my depression she became better at helping me. She listened and didn't judge. She let me talk and told didn't lecture but reassured my decisions. She went out of her way to make me feel more confident. That's the person you need to find. Also try writing your feeling down whatever you feel on a peace of paper what ever is on your mind. Write it in chicken scratch don't worry about how ty write just write what you feel. Then throw the paper away. That used to help me, not as much as my mom did but I did help.

Being terminally ill for the past 7 years (Im 42 now) the physical pain of a slow and horrible illness has led to my depression and desire to die. It is up to my wife though. And for her I live every day in hell. When you have even one person to keep you going, it can be enough. I am a lurker here and I read posts to give me perspective. Rarely can I physically reply. But what my experience being bound to a bed 24/7 has taught me is that once I made my peace with dying, I became indifferent to everything. For myself It's been tough to see people truly depressed to the point of wanting to die. I am very empathetic, but my depression is a symptom so its hard to understand. The one thing I do understand though is that the last thing you want to hear is Don't do it!!! Call this number... or other similar programmed/indoctrinated responses. So just know this... The world and life can be one big shitshow... So it helps to keep toilet paper handy. Let your friend be your toilet paper and be your friends toilet paper. It will be enough.  Lastly... Just remember that no matter how bad life feels (and is...) even I am artificially grateful for the fact that I have a far better life right now (suffering from *pain and bound to a bed), than 99.999999% of all humans to have ever lived. Just try to make it as long as you can. Know how much worse it can be. And let your toilet paper know that you need them to help clean up some shit. Then when you are ready to go.... You will know. But I cant see it happening for you as long as you remain attached to someone that you can call a friend. So give yourself a list of requirements that must be met for you to end it all. *- Pain so severe that causes me to vomit my own feces at times as it sends my body into shock. I wish you the best. I hope you can suffer less in time if possible. You and I are here right now... That makes us stronger than those who gave up yesterday. (And if you do one day come to the realization that you must go, make sure to do it in a way that allows your organs be given to help others. It helps me knowing that maybe I will have something that can give a healthy, long, and amazing life for a person who is still able to live it. ) Just think about making the list... And go tell your friend, right now, that you love him/her... Even if they are not quilted and only 1-ply thickness. You both need that right now... The whole world needs that right now.

I knew something was wrong but I was adamant it depression. Then I went to my doctor thinking I had an anxiety problem and he began to ask THE questions. I knew he was trying to see if I had depression and it caught me by surprise. Of course I lied for most of them. It would be embarrassing; there was no way I was depressed, but the thought had worked its way in. Over the course of a year I did some idle research. I realized suicidal thoughts and a fascination with death are not normal. I matched a lot of my behavior to symptoms of depression. I came to accept it.

Or, feel lonely and haven't got anybody; need to find somebody to stop feeling like that; need to know best places to find somebody; research ways to meet people and put self into that situation. Or feel worthless; being of use to someone or something would make me feel less worthless; dedicate myself to making myself of use to someone who needs somebody; use free time aiding charity or institution where people need you, and you can feel needed. Honestly, I know it's not that easy a fix, and there will be more bumps to overcome. One of my larger problems is isolation and loneliness, and even having looked at places to go, I still haven't found the courage to put myself into a situation to meet people. But generating a simple starting point where you can do something easily achievable, even just through reading online about how to get started, can make you feel proactive and start to get you into a more productive feeling that maybe it won't be like that forever, and that there is a physical, tangible, mortal way to deal with the situation. So, I would recommend pick a small goal that CAN lead to some form of happiness and work towards that, rather than try to envision this great milestone of achieving happiness in one big leap.

I know I can't claim to be an expert after reading just one textbook, but even an idiot can realize that your behavior and who you are is just totally as a result of your parents. The genetic aspects aren't their fault of course, but they are perfect human specimens, so you can imagine what 17 years of always being wrong has done to my self esteem and thought process. Strangely, being cognizant of that fact doesn't change it much. Of course, I've directly told my parents I blame them for who I am, and as perfect specimens, they told me that I can't keep blaming them for everything. There's truth to that of course, but it's rather incredible that they can find the gall to abdicate themselves of all guilt and responsibility. I'd better just get on my hands and knees and obey their every whim, since they're the ones who work and pay for my existence, regardless of whether or not I can actually do jack shit about that (child labor laws, yo).

Or, feel lonely and haven't got anybody; need to find somebody to stop feeling like that; need to know best places to find somebody; research ways to meet people and put self into that situation. Or feel worthless; being of use to someone or something would make me feel less worthless; dedicate myself to making myself of use to someone who needs somebody; use free time aiding charity or institution where people need you, and you can feel needed. Honestly, I know it's not that easy a fix, and there will be more bumps to overcome. One of my larger problems is isolation and loneliness, and even having looked at places to go, I still haven't found the courage to put myself into a situation to meet people. But generating a simple starting point where you can do something easily achievable, even just through reading online about how to get started, can make you feel proactive and start to get you into a more productive feeling that maybe it won't be like that forever, and that there is a physical, tangible, mortal way to deal with the situation. So, I would recommend pick a small goal that CAN lead to some form of happiness and work towards that, rather than try to envision this great milestone of achieving happiness in one big leap. Helps you take it day by day a little easier, and I hope that would make each new day, if not better, at least consistent for you. Feel better soon, bud.",

It's a daily nightmare. I would say that MAYBE, if I gave advice on it, it would be that I used to have a similar thing with shyness, and with that I pushed myself into more and more social situations and now am not so shy. It MAYBE might work the same way with liking/disliking social interaction. But I do that everyday and I still don't like people. I'm more COMFORTABLE around them, but I still don't LIKE them. And it's an entirely different ball park with depression/anxiety than shyness, otherwise if it were so easy to just 'force' yourself to socialize to fix the problem, I'd be doing it myself.

Once my mom knew the extent of my depression she became better at helping me. She listened and didn't judge. She let me talk and told didn't lecture but reassured my decisions. She went out of her way to make me feel more confident. That's the person you need to find. Also try writing your feeling down whatever you feel on a peace of paper what ever is on your mind. Write it in chicken scratch don't worry about how ty write just write what you feel. Then throw the paper away. That used to help me, not as much as my mom did but I did help. Life isn't something we can live alone although a lot of us want to, I wish I could, find someone to confide in that supports you.",

Or, feel lonely and haven't got anybody; need to find somebody to stop feeling like that; need to know best places to find somebody; research ways to meet people and put self into that situation. Or feel worthless; being of use to someone or something would make me feel less worthless; dedicate myself to making myself of use to someone who needs somebody; use free time aiding charity or institution where people need you, and you can feel needed. Honestly, I know it's not that easy a fix, and there will be more bumps to overcome. One of my larger problems is isolation and loneliness, and even having looked at places to go, I still haven't found the courage to put myself into a situation to meet people. But generating a simple starting point where you can do something easily achievable, even just through reading online about how to get started, can make you feel proactive and start to get you into a more productive feeling that maybe it won't be like that forever, and that there is a physical, tangible, mortal way to deal with the situation. So, I would recommend pick a small goal that CAN lead to some form of happiness and work towards that, rather than try to envision this great milestone of achieving happiness in one big leap. Helps you take it day by day a little easier, and I hope that would make each new day, if not better, at least consistent for you. Feel better soon, bud.",

I learned how to deal with the symptoms a lot better than I did from years prior.. looking back.. thst could've gone poorly. I'd recommend being open in discussion with your psychiatrist about the effects these drugs are having on your body and your mood. There are quite a few drug combinations for this type of diagnosis, and it would be wise to work dilligently with your psychiatrist until you find the combination for you. Don't be afraid of them changing your meds. They aren't work anyway, so you may as well be open to working with professionals to find something that works for you and your body. I'd also recommend to try being aware as possible if the symptoms, the triggers for those symptoms, and look to grow from them even while on these medications. Keep a close eye out for unwanted side effects. A lot of the medicines they may try to prescribe would require regular schedules blood work. I'll be honest, I did the irresponsible thing and ended up just not taking them. I got tired of taking medicine at that point; because, I had been taking it all my life. Whether it was for childhood epilepsy, ADHD, depression, and the last diagnosis cyclothymia. Was hospitalized twice before I got the cyclothymia diagnosis, and it was pretty bad at one point, and looking back.. I'm really lucky I didn't mess myself up by just stopping cold turkey. Work with your psychiatrist and maybe even work with a therapist if you can. Do all you can do to find the proper treatment, and YOU WILL BE OKAY. You are not",

Or, feel lonely and haven't got anybody; need to find somebody to stop feeling like that; need to know best places to find somebody; research ways to meet people and put self into that situation. Or feel worthless; being of use to someone or something would make me feel less worthless; dedicate myself to making myself of use to someone who needs somebody; use free time aiding charity or institution where people need you, and you can feel needed.

One of my larger problems is isolation and loneliness, and even having looked at places to go, I still haven't found the courage to put myself into a situation to meet people. But generating a simple starting point where you can do something easily achievable, even just through reading online about how to get started, can make you feel proactive and start to get you into a more productive feeling that maybe it won't be like that forever, and that there is a physical, tangible, mortal way to deal with the situation. So, I would recommend pick a small goal that CAN lead to some form of happiness and work towards that, rather than try to envision this great milestone of achieving happiness in one big leap. Helps you take it day by day a little easier, and I hope that would make each new day, if not better, at least consistent for you. Feel better soon, bud.",

Being terminally ill for the past 7 years (Im 42 now) the physical pain of a slow and horrible illness has led to my depression and desire to die. It is up to my wife though. And for her I live every day in hell. When you have even one person to keep you going, it can be enough. I am a lurker here and I read posts to give me perspective. Rarely can I physically reply. But what my experience being bound to a bed 24/7 has taught me is that once I made my peace with dying, I became indifferent to everything. For myself It's been tough to see people truly depressed to the point of wanting to die. I am very empathetic, but my depression is a symptom so its hard to understand. The one thing I do understand though is that the last thing you want to hear is Don't do it!!! Call this number... or other similar programmed/indoctrinated responses. So just know this... The world and life can be one big shitshow... So it helps to keep toilet paper handy. Let your friend be your toilet paper and be your friends toilet paper. It will be enough.  Lastly... Just remember that no matter how bad life feels (and is...) even I am artificially grateful for the fact that I have a far better life right now (suffering from *pain and bound to a bed), than 99.999999% of all humans to have ever lived. Just try to make it as long as you can. Know how much worse it can be. And let your toilet paper know that you need them to help clean up some shit. Then when you are ready to go.... You will know. But I cant see it happening for you as long as you remain attached to someone that you can call a friend. So give yourself a list of requirements that must be met for you to end it all. *- Pain so severe that causes me to vomit my own feces at times as it sends my body into shock. I wish you the best. I hope you can suffer less in time if possible. You and I are here right now... That makes us stronger than those who gave up yesterday. (And if you do one day come to the realization that you must go, make sure to do it in a way that allows your organs be given to help others. It helps me knowing that maybe I will have something that can give a healthy, long, and amazing life for a person who is still able to live it. ) Just think about making the list... And go tell your friend, right now, that you love him/her... Even if they are not quilted and only 1-ply thickness. You both need that right now... The whole world needs that right now.

For me essential to plan my assignments in advance, so that I can just do things one by one and not let it all get piled up cuz then I wanna die. Also, if you need a break, take one. School will always be there but good to take care of yourself too :)",

I used to be depressed over my bad grades and I had this constant anxious feeling that my life was over because of these bad grades and I would amount to nothing. Then all of a sudden one day, I noticed that bad grades in high school aren't the end of the world. It might have been because I moved out of my Dad's place and I didn't have to hear him call me a failure anymore. Either way, I became happy again. Then I met her. A nice girl who was my age. She had a pretty face, we had a ton of classes together, and she thought I was really funny. I was able to open up to her. I think (I know) I fell in love with her. She had a boyfriend though. He's a shitty person. He's high all the time and he always flirts around with other girls. I really thought she would break it off with him and find her way to my arms and I'd be the happiest guy in the world. That didn't happen. I became desperate. I began to have a drinking problem because of it. One night while very drunk I texted her a bunch of things about my depression. I don't think she cares about me anymore. Now I find myself drunk and alone for the umpteenth time wondering how I let myself get depressed again.  Basically what I wanna say to you is: your life's not over, it's just beginning. Whatever it is that makes you feel like a failure is probably a problem that is possible to overcome. Just focus on you and don't let other people get in your way and bring you down like I did. Don't let anyone else determine your happiness. Control your life. You can do it.",
